    excerpt: " **Welcome!** <br /> <br /> I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). <br />  <br />

    My research examines how states govern through violence and non-state intermediaries, with a focus on criminal groups, militias, and other armed actors. I study how these relationships shape state capacity, democratic accountability, and civilian security across both historical and contemporary contexts.
    <br /> <br />

    My work combines archival research, causal inference, and survey experiments, and draws on evidence from Mexico, British India, Northern Ireland, and Mozambique.
       
     <br /> <br />
    Prior to joining Emory University, I received my B.A. in [Political Science](https://politicalscience.unca.edu/) from the [University of North Carolina Asheville](https://www.unca.edu/) in 2020, where I was awarded the [2020 Big South Christenberry Award](https://uncabulldogs.com/news/2020/5/20/womens-swimming-diving-adee-weller-receives-2020-big-south-christenberry-award.aspx) and was nominated for [NCAA Woman of the Year](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2020/7/14/ncaa-schools-announce-nominees-for-2020-ncaa-woman-of-the-year.aspx). I am originally from Boulder, Colorado."
