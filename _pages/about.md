**Welcome!**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html).

My research examines how states govern through violence and non-state intermediaries, with a focus on criminal groups, militias, and other armed actors. I study how these relationships shape state capacity, democratic accountability, and civilian security across both historical and contemporary contexts.

My work combines archival research, causal inference, and survey experiments, and draws on evidence from Mexico, British India, Northern Ireland, Haiti, and Mozambique.

As a co-founder of Women in [Political Science at Emory (WiPS-E)](https://x.com/WomeninPSEmory), I am committed to building and empowering a diverse and inclusive research community that bridges academic and policy networks.

Before Emory, I earned my B.A. in [Political Science](https://politicalscience.unca.edu/) from [UNC Asheville](https://www.unca.edu/) in 2020, where I received the [Big South Christenberry Award](https://uncabulldogs.com/news/2020/5/20/womens-swimming-diving-adee-weller-receives-2020-big-south-christenberry-award.aspx) and was nominated for [NCAA Woman of the Year](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2020/7/14/ncaa-schools-announce-nominees-for-2020-ncaa-woman-of-the-year.aspx). I am originally from Boulder, Colorado.
