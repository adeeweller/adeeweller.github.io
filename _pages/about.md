I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). My research delves into the intricate dynamics between violent groups that do not seek to change the political status quo -- such as organized crime, armed corporations, and pro-government militias -- and state actors. I investigate the far-reaching and unexpected consequences of their collusion. My dissertation examines how institutional change shapes violent groups' relationship to the state, the internal processes by which they make decisions, and the consequences of collusion on democratic accountability.  

I have regional experise in Latin America, particularly Mexico, where I focus on organized criminal groups. I also study armed groups and their interaction with British rule in two historical contexts: Bengal (Northeastern India) under East India Company control, and Northern Ireland during the Troubles.

In my other projects, I examine why states collaborate with certain pro-government militia groups, formalize their influence on electoral outcomes, and examine how armed groups delegate coercive capacity. Methodologically, I adopt a multi-method approach, including deep-learning models (Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing), design-based casual inference, and qualitative analyses.

Prior to joining Emory University, I received my B.A. in [Political Science](https://politicalscience.unca.edu/) from the [University of North Carolina Asheville](https://www.unca.edu/) in 2020, where I was awarded the [2020 Big South Christenberry Award](https://uncabulldogs.com/news/2020/5/20/womens-swimming-diving-adee-weller-receives-2020-big-south-christenberry-award.aspx) and was nominated for [NCAA Woman of the Year](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2020/7/14/ncaa-schools-announce-nominees-for-2020-ncaa-woman-of-the-year.aspx).
