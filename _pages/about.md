**Welcome!** <br /> <br /> I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). <br />


I study how states govern in fragmented and contested settings by outsourcing coercive power to actors such as criminal organizations, pro-government militias, and multinational corporations---groups that do not seek to overthrow the state but nonetheless profoundly shape its development. Drawing on archival research, fieldwork, causal inference, and large-scale text analysis, I examine these dynamics across diverse contexts including Mexico, Mozambique, Northern Ireland, Haiti, and Bengal.
<br /> 

My dissertation investigates how authorities leverage criminal violence as a tool of coercion to manipulate elite coalitions and sustain extractive governance, drawing on a novel collection of internal documents from the English East India Company (1769â€“1773). I have received funding for this through the [National Science Foundation](https://apsanet.org/programs/doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grants/) and the American Political Science Association (DDRIG).
<br /> 
     
I employ a multi-method empirical approach that includes:

- Deep learning techniques (computer vision and natural language processing).
- Design-based causal inference.
- Archival analysis and qualitative process tracing.
<br /> 

Some other current projects include:

- How the introduction of mayoral reelection in Mexico affects criminal infiltration into elections.
- Why the British state collaborated with Loyalist militias during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, using declassified conversations among top officials.
- How natural resource shocks in Mozambique shape infrastructure investment and illicit economies.
- How the anticipation of international military intervention shapes gang violence and civilian mobility in Haiti.
<br /> 

As a co-founder of Women in [Political Science at Emory (WiPS-E)](https://x.com/WomeninPSEmory), I am committed to building and empowering a diverse and inclusive research community that reaches across both academic and policy networks.
<br />

Before Emory, I earned my B.A. in [Political Science](https://politicalscience.unca.edu/) from [UNC Asheville](https://www.unca.edu/) in 2020, where I received the [Big South Christenberry Award](https://uncabulldogs.com/news/2020/5/20/womens-swimming-diving-adee-weller-receives-2020-big-south-christenberry-award.aspx) and was nominated for [NCAA Woman of the Year](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2020/7/14/ncaa-schools-announce-nominees-for-2020-ncaa-woman-of-the-year.aspx). I'm originally from Boulder, Colorado.
