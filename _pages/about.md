I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). I study the intersection of organized crime and politics. 
My research interests include the interactions between criminal actors, criminal governance, and the impacts of crime on local politics.
In my research, I combine causal inference and formal modeling with qualitative and quantitative methods.

Prior to joining Emory University, I received my B.A. in [Political Science](https://politicalscience.unca.edu/) from the [University of North Carolina Asheville](https://www.unca.edu/) in 2020, where I was nominated for NCAA Woman of the Year as a member of the swim team.
