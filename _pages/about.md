As a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), my research explores the intricate dynamics between violent business -- such as organized crime syndicates, armed corporations, and pro-government militias -- and state actors, investigating the implications of their collusion on governance structures and democratic accountability.

My dissertation investigates the impact of institutional changes on the relationship between violent groups and the state, examining the internal decision-making processes of these groups and the consequences of their collusion for democratic accountability. Regionally, I specialize in Latin America, particularly Mexico, where I focus on the behavior and strategies of organized criminal groups.

Additionally, I delve into historical contexts, studying the interaction between armed groups and British rule in Northeastern India during the East India Company era and in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, with a particular focus on how the organizational challenges of armed groups shape their behaviors.

Beyond my dissertation, my research interests include understanding why states choose to collaborate with specific pro-government militia groups, examining the formalization of armed groups' influence on electoral outcomes, and analyzing how these groups delegate coercive capacity.

Methodologically, I employ a multi-method approach, combining deep-learning models such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing with design-based causal inference techniques and qualitative analyses to provide comprehensive insights into complex political phenomena.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my B.A. in Political Science from the University of North Carolina Asheville in 2020, where I was recognized with the [2020 Big South Christenberry Award](https://uncabulldogs.com/news/2020/5/20/womens-swimming-diving-adee-weller-receives-2020-big-south-christenberry-award.aspx) and nominated for [NCAA Woman of the Year](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2020/7/14/ncaa-schools-announce-nominees-for-2020-ncaa-woman-of-the-year.aspx).
