**Welcome!**

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html).

My research examines how states govern through violence and non-state intermediaries, with a focus on criminal groups, militias, and other armed actors. I study how these relationships shape state capacity, democratic accountability, and civilian security across both historical and contemporary contexts.

I combine archival research and causal inference with mixed-methods approaches, drawing upon evidence from Mexico, British India, Northern Ireland, Haiti, and Mozambique. My research has been published in the *British Journal of Political Science* and is supported by the National Science Foundation and the Pearson Institute for Global Governance.

As a co-founder of Women in [Political Science at Emory (WiPS-E)](https://x.com/WomeninPSEmory), I am committed to building and empowering a diverse and inclusive research community that bridges academic and policy networks.

Before Emory, I earned my B.A. in Political Science from UNC Asheville, where I received the [Big South Christenberry Award](https://uncabulldogs.com/news/2020/5/20/womens-swimming-diving-adee-weller-receives-2020-big-south-christenberry-award.aspx) and was nominated for [NCAA Woman of the Year](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2020/7/14/ncaa-schools-announce-nominees-for-2020-ncaa-woman-of-the-year.aspx). I am originally from Boulder, Colorado.
