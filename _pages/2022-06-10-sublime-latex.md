DON'T FORGET TO EDIT, LINK TO THE PREVIOUS POST ON INSTALLING SUBLIME

## Introduction

Are you looking for an easy, fast, and flexible text editor, but aren't sure where to start? Are you easily distracted and want all your files, programs, and projects in the same place? Do you want a editor than can handle a wide array of languages, programs, and platorms? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then Sublime Text Editor is may be a great fit for you.

I first started using Sublime as a Political Science major in undergrad -- and I had no clue what I was doing. Like many others, I had no experience with any sort of coding, and just thinking about mysterious lines on a screen made my head spin. And I wasn't using it for python yet, only R and LaTeX. But within a short period of time, I was up and running. 

In this post, let us walk through what Sublime is, why may be the right fit for you, and how to get it set up with R, LaTeX, Python, and more!

## What is Sublime?

Sublime is a text editor. To be more specific, Sublime is a sophisticated, cross-platform source code editor. It supports a variety of programming and markup languages, and features an array of plugins, which are typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses. You can think about Sublime as the swiss-army knife of text editing. The plugin ecosystem and its extensability make Sublime a worthy choice. It's incredibly fast and lightweight. An annual subscription costs $99 USD, but note that the free trial period is unlimited.

While downloading Sublime is easy, setting it up to work with R, LaTeX, and other platforms is often less straight forward. But don't be intimidated -- it can be quite easy and straight forward. For this tutorial, I am going to assume you already have Sublime and Package Control set up on your computer. If you don't already have Sublime, check out my previous post on [Setting up Sublime with R]({% post_url 2022-06-10-sublime_setup %}).

Want to wrap several paragraphs or other elements in a notice? Using Liquid to capture the content and then filter it with `markdownify` is a good way to go.

```html
{% raw %}{% capture notice-2 %}
#### New Site Features

* You can now have cover images on blog pages
* Drafts will now auto-save while writing
{% endcapture %}{% endraw %}

<div class="notice">{% raw %}{{ notice-2 | markdownify }}{% endraw %}</div>
```

{% capture notice-2 %}
#### New Site Features

* You can now have cover images on blog pages
* Drafts will now auto-save while writing
{% endcapture %}

<div class="notice">
  {{ notice-2 | markdownify }}
</div>

Or you could skip the capture and stick with straight HTML.

```html
<div class="notice">
  <h4>Message</h4>
  <p>A basic message.</p>
</div>
```

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Message</h4>
  <p>A basic message.</p>
</div> -->
