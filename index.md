    title: "About Me"
    excerpt: "I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Political Science](http://polisci.emory.edu/home/index.html) at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). <br />  <br />
    
    I study the intersection of organized crime and politics. My research interests include the interactions between criminal actors, criminal governance, and the impacts of crime on local politics. In my research, I combine causal inference and formal modeling with Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. <br /> <br />
    
    Prior to joining Emory University, I received my B.A. in [Political Science](https://politicalscience.unca.edu/) from the [University of North Carolina Asheville](https://www.unca.edu/) in 2020, where I won the [2020 Big South Christenberry Award](https://uncabulldogs.com/news/2020/5/20/womens-swimming-diving-adee-weller-receives-2020-big-south-christenberry-award.aspx) and was nominated for [NCAA Woman of the Year](https://www.ncaa.org/news/2020/7/14/ncaa-schools-announce-nominees-for-2020-ncaa-woman-of-the-year.aspx) as a member of the swim team."
